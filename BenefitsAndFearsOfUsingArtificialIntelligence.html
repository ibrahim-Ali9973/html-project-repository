 <big>in agriculture and medicine we find that artificial intelligence is important on the part of agriculture in knowing the weather that is suitable for cultivation, as well as good soil in agriculture, and how we can make crops good and increase in production, also we find it important in medicine in terms of knowing the necessary diagnosis for each disease, as well as knowing which treatment is appropriate for it Well, to cure it. Through the two domains, we find that there is always a noticeable development, and the development does not stop at a specific place. As for medicine, we find that the development has become more than before by the treatment used for the patient, so it  is possible to monitor our patients to know the doses that they do not take through advanced devices from afar, as well We find that in the field of agriculture, there are machines used in agriculture that are more advanced than before, and they cannot delay like previous machines, but we also find them fast and good in dealing with them. It has a great importance from the employment side, so that we find that the number of applicants for any job needs it very much, and also we find that the knowledge of the CV needs a computer equipped for this purpose, a person cannot afford all this number and sort it completely, also we find it important for Customer service, so that we find that in order to communicate with the largest possible number of clients, a computer is required to  help with this, there is no person who can bear the response to all this huge number in a simple time.</big><br/>

 <big>Whenever we use artificial intelligence in many areas around us, we fear at the time not caring about any human race and not needing it in any work, there has become an alternative that is able to make everything that the human race does. Fear also of the ability of any device with artificial intelligence to repair itself, i.e. it does not need human hands in order to be seen and repaired, and this is one of the most dangerous things, so this intelligence should not negatively affect society, and we find that the lack of development of these devices is in the interest Humans, so that there are no fears that cause us to worry about it, it is scary to control robots everywhere instead of any human being, this is a catastrophe so that we find that these robots do not need any requests, so they will provide many, but they will make big problems as well. Also, we cannot imagine our life without using artificial intelligence, because it is very general in life, so whatever concerns it, we cannot control many things without it, so we have to understand this well and not make it equal to humans. But it has the importance necessary to help people only, and it should not be equal or better, but rather, it is very necessary to know and pay attention to it, and it must not be destroyed completely in order not to regret this.</big><br/><br/><br/>
