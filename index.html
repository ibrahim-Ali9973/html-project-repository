<big><big>Artificial intelligence acquires information through practical practices, and is able to accurately distinguish between multiple issues. One of the most important capabilities of artificial intelligence is its response to variables, and is characterized by flexibility and speed of reaction in all situations. Artificial intelligence has its ability to perceive, and thus make decisions properly, depending on studying all the possibilities and mastering its results, and then choosing the best decisions that lead to the desired results. Quickly be able to detect and correct errors, and make better improvements in the future.</big></big><br/><br/>
